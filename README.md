## Working with me

### Here's a few things that might be helpful to know when working together.

#### üìÜ Schedule
There's always situations in which things need to be rushed, but unless it's critical I prefer planning the work ahead with realistic timelines. I usually approach work with a test-driven development mindset, so accounting for tests within the schedule is a must.

#### üëÇ Point of view
I enjoy when people ask for and value my point of view.

#### üñêÔ∏è Communication
I work autonomously very well but I love connecting with people and discussing different options with colleagues. Having someone in the team I can ask for advice or help is something I value very much.

#### ü§ù Respect
I thrive in a respectful working environment (like everybody) where communication and organization are core principles.
